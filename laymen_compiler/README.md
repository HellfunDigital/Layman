# Laymen Programming Language

Laymen is a programming language designed for non-programmers to create PC software. It prioritizes simplicity, English-like syntax, intuitive constructs, and visual programming support.

## Features

1. **Simplicity**: Laymen is designed to be easy to understand and use, even for non-programmers. It avoids complex syntax and jargon commonly found in traditional programming languages.

2. **English-like Syntax**: Laymen uses a syntax that resembles English as much as possible. This approach helps users grasp the language more easily.

3. **Intuitive Constructs**: Laymen provides intuitive constructs and abstractions that align with common programming tasks. This includes features like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

4. **Visual Programming Support**: Laymen incorporates visual programming elements. A drag-and-drop interface or visual code blocks make it easier for users to express their logic and build applications visually.

## Documentation and Tutorials

Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples guide users through the language's features and the process of building PC software. Check out the `laymen_language_documentation.py` and `laymen_language_tutorials.py` files for more information.

## Debugging and Error Handling

Laymen provides clear error messages and debugging tools to help users identify and correct issues in their code. For more details, refer to the `laymen_debugger.py` and `laymen_error_handler.py` files.

## Integration with Common Libraries and APIs

Laymen provides easy integration with commonly used libraries and APIs for tasks such as user interfaces, file operations, and network communication. See `laymen_api_integration.py` for more details.

## Community Support and Sharing

We encourage the creation of a vibrant community where Laymen users can share their projects, ask questions, and collaborate. For community-related functions, refer to `laymen_community_support.py`.

## Compatibility and Performance

While focusing on simplicity, Laymen can produce efficient and performant software. For performance and compatibility-related functions, refer to `laymen_performance.py` and `laymen_compatibility.py`.

## Iterative Development

We gather feedback from our target audience—non-programmers—and iterate on the language design based on their input. For iterative development-related functions, refer to `laymen_iterative_development.py`.

## Testing

All components of Laymen are thoroughly tested. Check out the `tests` directory for all test files.

## Getting Started

To get started with Laymen, clone this repository and run `laymen_compiler.py`. Happy coding!
