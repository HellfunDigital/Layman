Shared Dependencies:

1. **Laymen Language Core**: This is the core language module that is shared across all files. It includes the basic syntax, constructs, and rules of the Laymen language.

2. **Laymen Compiler**: This module is used by the compiler, transpiler, and interpreter files. It contains the logic for converting Laymen code into executable code.

3. **Laymen Lexer and Parser**: These modules are used by the compiler, transpiler, interpreter, and debugger files. They are responsible for breaking down Laymen code into tokens and constructing a parse tree.

4. **Laymen Error Handler**: This module is used by all files that execute or analyze Laymen code. It provides functions for handling and reporting errors.

5. **Laymen Debugger**: This module is used by the compiler, interpreter, and error handler files. It provides debugging tools and functions.

6. **Laymen API Integration**: This module is used by the compiler, interpreter, and visual programming support files. It provides functions for integrating with external libraries and APIs.

7. **Laymen Visual Programming Support**: This module is used by the compiler and interpreter files. It provides functions for visual programming features.

8. **Laymen Documentation and Tutorials**: These modules are used by the README and community support files. They provide the content for the language's documentation and tutorials.

9. **Laymen Community Support**: This module is used by the README and iterative development files. It provides functions for community interaction and feedback collection.

10. **Laymen Performance and Compatibility**: These modules are used by the compiler, interpreter, and optimizer files. They provide functions for performance optimization and compatibility checks.

11. **Laymen Iterative Development**: This module is used by all files as it provides functions for gathering user feedback and iterating on the language design.

12. **Test Modules**: These modules are used by all test files. They provide functions for testing the functionality and performance of the Laymen language and its components.
